## Recap
Definitely made this one a little more difficult than I needed. My biggest issue was I tried to abbreviate width and height as w and h. I am curious to know if I would have switched it across the board so svgheight was svgh if that wouldve helped. But my guess is that it has something to do with single letters and javascript not liking us to declare them as their own variable. Took me hours and hours to find this simple issue that was causing the sizing to be all sorts of crazy. It would be small and cut off. The real issue though was that it wasnt punching me out an error code so I was going mad over and over things that were completely unrealted. But once I fixed this everything fell into place and the axis labels showed back up as well.

I am interested to check out the bonus in the future. I think the application of having multiple axis options is really cool and I could see a lot of practical uses for sharing data in a readable format.
